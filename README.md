# no-x
userscripts to reject the X.

## installation

- [x to =w=](https://github.com/Silveere/no-x/raw/main/x_to_-w-_with_favicon.user.js) - changes the X logo to a text emote in the sidebar and favicon
- [manifest fucker](https://github.com/Silveere/no-x/raw/main/twitter-pwa-manifest.user.js) - replaces the PWA manifest with one that has the old logo and app name
